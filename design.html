            <h1 class="major">My Design Philosophy</h1>
            <p>
                As a developer, I've arrived at an approach/mindset that I feel is good to take towards development
                projects of any sort. I've broken this approach down into a collection of tenants/points.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>
                        Readability and ease-of-use
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I try to write all of my code as if I'm writing a library for public
                        use. I aim to have intuitive class, method
                        and field names, leave approachable and concise comments, and have my code be usable with straightforward methods
                        and design that make sense, work as expected, and keep highly complex and error-prone code under-the-hood.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>
                        Performance as a priority
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Even if performance is not necessarily (yet) a concern at a given point, I prioritize
                        the optimization and slimming-down of code as I write and edit it. While I certainly leave
                        room for further optimizations, I aim to prevent performance-inefficient code from being 'tolerated'
                        and building-up until performance is noticeably degraded -- and then becomes a difficult problem to fix
                        as it has a hundred different possible culprits.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>
                        Plan for the most unlikely scenarios
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        In my experience, an essential piece to writing durable
                        and robust code is to rule out every possible unexpected or problematic outcome, regardless of likelihood. An anomaly
                        that has even the slimmest chances of happening should be planned for, lest the code be assumed
                        functional, and then distributed, only to eventually crash and burn due to an obscure and
                        preventable flaw.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>
                        Attention to detail
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I take a highly detail-oriented approach to
                        writing code, one that aims to leave no question unasked with regard to performance implications,
                        edge cases that may break the code, and the possibility of
                        alternate routes should the current approach be unsatisfactory to any extent.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>
                        Quality over results
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        My goal when writing code is not just to accomplish the result
                        that's been set out, but to focus my attention additionally on
                        accomplishing that goal in the right way. The right way, in my opinion, is that
                        which is as resource-efficient as possible. I define resource-efficiency as being
                        a consciousness of memory usage & allocation, of latency (in the context of a Minecraft server),
                        and thirdly, simply of complexity. I always try to strike a balance between
                        complexity and raw resource-efficiency, as overcomplexity can in turn degrade the readability and maintainability
                        of code.

                    <h3>
                        Tools are essential
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        In an environment like that of building a (likely complex) Spigot
                        minigame, taking the time to build out tools and utilities that make it easier and smoother to develop
                        actual content is something that I view as being essential. Often, working with certain aspects
                        of minigame development, NMS or SQL for example, is something that can be both highly complex
                        and also unintuitive, and as such, more prone to human error. A tool that repackages those difficult operations
                        into something usable can prevent those errors, saving time that would be wasted fixing preventable bugs.
                        Tools can also make certain code easier to understand for developers who are new to it, and honestly,
                        they can even make the function of our own code easier to remember when coming back to it after some time.
                        Tools mean that ultimately more developer time can be spent actually building out games and features rather than constantly
                        trudging through time-consuming use of unintuitive raw code.
