							<h1 class="major">About me</h1>
							<p>
								Hi! I'm Kebriel, a 20-year-old LGBTQIA+ developer with a specialty in Java, and the Spigot/Bukkit API
								specifically. Here are some facts about me, some that are about me as a person and some about me as a developer.
							</p>
							<p>
								I come from a low income and mixed racial background, and I'm also disabled with a degenerative musculoskeletal condition.
								These are facts that has most definitely impacted my journey as a developer, whether it be lack of resource access, circumstantial constraints, or
								physical constraints, it's certainly been an uphill battle to gain the proficiency that I have.
							</p>
							<p>
								I'm entirely self-taught, save for a single semester-long Java course in high school. I began
								learning Java and Bukkit in 5th grade, and I did so secretly on my mom's old laptop that she used for
								school as I wasn't permitted much in the way of video game access. As I had no device when at school or friends' houses,
								I would just sketch out my preformed understanding of Java and Bukkit code while bored
								in class -- lots of basic while loops, and many iterations of "if(sender instanceof Player)" from basic
								tutorials I had watched on how to make a command. I nursed a plan to create my own server network with a group of friends for years
								-- something that, funnily enough, wasn't finally put to rest until the end of 2020 when I fully switched focus to my full-time job at FieldClock LLC.
							</p>
