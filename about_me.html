							<h1 class="major">About me</h1>
							<p>
								Hi! I'm Kebriel, a 20-year-old LGBTQIA+ developer with a specialty in Java, and the Spigot/Bukkit API
								specifically.
							</p>
							<h3>
								My Journey as a Developer
							</h3>
							<p>
								I come from a low income and mixed racial background, and I'm also disabled with a degenerative musculoskeletal condition
								that has only begun to properly establish itself in the last few years. These facts have
								certainly had great effect on my journey as a developer, which is one that often was made
								more complex and trying as a result of factors like poor resource access and the like.
							</p>
							<p>
								Programming has long been a strong interest of mine.
								I'm an entirely self-taught developer, save for a single semester-long Java course in high school.
								Having recently got into Minecraft for the first time in 4th grade, I began learning Java and Bukkit in 5th grade.
								Truthfully, I had tried to get into modding first, but Forge was more intimidating for me at the time
								and I've also never been adept at graphic design -- especially not as a kid with nothing but
								paint.net at my disposal for texturing. I would bounce between the two for a little while,
								until the beginning of middle school when my friends and I set to building our
								own server network.
							</p>
							<p>
								That plan wasn't finally put to rest until the very end of 2020 when I decided
								to entirely pivot my focus to my full-time job. But from about 2014 to 2020, I ambitiously developed
								thorough, elaborate ideas for the server network, which was going to be called Program Zeta. Though
								they were always a good space behind the idea-crafting, my skills in Java & Spigot first
								and foremost, and then NMS as I became more comfortable delving further, saw steady improvement
								year after year.
							</p>
							<p>
								My programming journey has been a predominantly solitary
								one. Even when collaborating with friends on our server network idea, I was the
								sole programmer. At FieldClock LLC, I did get a chance at a more team-oriented, collaborative programming
								space, an aspect that I enjoyed greatly. Of course, it wasn't Java we were writing, so I
								was a little out of my comfort zone at the time. For personal reasons and as a result of an approach to management
								that didn't sit well with me on the part of my superior, I terminated my contract there
								towards the middle of the second quarter of 2021. But, it was still absolutely an invaluable professional learning experience
								in numerous ways, one that I am glad to have experienced.
							</p>
							<h3>
								Present Day
							</h3>
							<p>
								I'm happy to say that I now live happily with my incredible partner in our apartment in Seattle. I have three cats, my
								partner has a dog, and we both love cooking, plants and concerts. They play the harp, I play piano
								and used to play a bit of clarinet back in the day. A little over a year ago, I finished my first
								fantasy novel, and rewriting it + writing its sequel is always a favorite side project of mine to come
								back to.
							</p>
							<p>
								Some random facts about me: I enjoy dark & intense television, crystals & gemstones, early and pre-modern history especially of the Balkans and
								Turkey, and tiramisu.
								I'm driven by imagining and building things (not physical things, digital projects). Nothing motivates
								me more than designing, creating and building something -- which is a piece of why I've always been
								so drawn to development.
							</p>
